# cult-of-akira-yokai
Yokai was sweeter than Akira. When she exploded it killed a lot of souls. A doomsday cult organizes youth and protests the newly formed government when a girl and a boy emerge who can save the world or destroy it.

Akira and Yokai were good little Japanese Nazis. They were loved and they were a part of a sssss ssssnakey super secret organization who was training them to be super NAZI soldiers. Akira killed himself. Yokai was a different story entirely... she still lives!
