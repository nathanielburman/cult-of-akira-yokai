Yokai was sweeter than Akira. When she exploded it killed a lot of souls. A doomsday cult organizes youth and protests the newly formed government when a girl and a boy emerge who can save the world or destroy it.

Akira and Yokai were good little Japanese Nazis. They were loved and they were a part of a sssss ssssnakey super secret organization who was training them to be super NAZI soldiers. Akira killed himself. Yokai was a different story entirely... she still lives!

These Japanese Nazis be lov'in on that White Nazi. These people owned slaves and they owned slaved before the war and they owned slaves after wars secretly in secret organizations that were also death cults.

There was ssss a second explosion. They covered it up and said she died but had no evidence of her body.

In school she was called Yuki alot by people who didn't want to call her Yokai becasue of curses.

There were fifty hundred bodies that died in this actualy explosion from the movie we proudly present.

The doomsday cults are getting in number again. They are claiming territories in certain places and they are ridiculed in certain other places. The death cults are starting to outnumber the cults of the living again. Live Laugh & Love cults are dying and in search of something to buy, something on a sale. 

...

Doomsday cults are real cults. They are normal cults actually. This is a picture of a death cult taking over a local suburb. This is how they spread the bomb.

Doomsday cults take over all cults for brief moments in time, all the time.


This is a map of the area where the largest death cult hold power over. They vote.

Its called Subtopia and they worship a cyber freak named what did he just say? This guys head explodes just thinking about the name of the egirl. Its not me either.

...

They do not worship the bomb yet. Their symbols for death are different. Swastika, Skull and Bones, etc. they were building a army and weapon to use to destroy the world with but they were just children.

Yokai was evil. An evil little girl. She excelled in her studies and was terribly evil. For her, studies were easy to make her slaves do for her. Her mental powers were incredible at a young age. It was like thousands of souls were combining to wield her as a slave of their own. But she was the master. She was an honor student. And she became a therapist using mind control to accomplish a great task that was wiped off the face of the Earth in a single moment.

There were fifty hundred thousand sould killed in this blast which is represented in this image.

A DVIERGANT REALITY

[Akira is not exactly dead. Tetsuo is not exactly dead. Yokai is not dead at all. Tetsuo went mental and outside of the matrix system when he was in the bar siting on his throne. He allows his body to recompose itself into fleshatombomb. With his body out of the picture and his friends gone, he had to expose of the body somehow, you can re watch this scene and see differences if we change it. He controled technology for decades before and after the event. THere are two divergant realities one: where Tetsuo dies after maxing tech and organics. or Two: Tetsuo maxes out of reality, then dies at the end in the movie. Akira didnt prevent Tetsuo from exploding, why in fact he helped it to explode more!

This ugly person in this image is a version of my body after full max, like split seconds after a full max occurs, your entire being will merge.
<img src="https://github.com/nathanielburman/cult-of-akira-yokai/blob/main/12227dream_TradingCard.jpg" width="500px"></img>

The design was to destroy itself. After Tetsuo maxes out he 'destroys' himself here. Technicaly, by quantum standards he still sits in his maxed out form. If you disturb him in that state you could get dead in a death cult killing on the internet you silly fuck. You thought I was just telling a story, well I am not. I said I wouldn't mess with Akira, but I am creating a divergant reality of PARODY where I will actually not tell any story about Akira or Tetsuo or any previously created creation, I will only  write for the creatures I create which are to PARODY your creations.]

I am also seen in this image, the previous image was an image of my enemy. my enemy, not maxed at all, but simping for some chinese cat kittenofloooooove that I can't do this right now, just kidding, lol. This is actually me in my fully maxed form within split seconds after my max into my max form. Enlightenment is not like this at all. Illumination is different. Trinities are just made up fairy tales. and genocide is on the menu becasu their bitches are out for blood. It's round two muther fuckers. Yokai Yuki and some early egirl from 19XX's are walking along a path from school.

She and her friends, egirls AA and AS enter the scene. Yuki looks that the girls and removes all humanity from their bodies. She devours their bodies instantly. Their souls trapped inside of a legendary seal. They all met at the cult meeting.

At the cult meeting it is so swell. at the cult meetings where secrets dwell. at the cult meetings where I merry so well. at the cult wedding where i fell oh so fell. at the cult wedding where my toes were with delight... kill yourself right now at the count of seven by my count, think for one second and let a bomb go off inside of your head and then die. Now. No, okay, I just meant Now, with that out of the way. These egirls from 19XX are killed again somehow in a quantum realm and they go inside of her. Their families will haunt her. All of the children and grandparents and uncles and aunts will haunt her.

These cult meetings are dangerous. I once saw a girl go there and she became a devil worshiper. She said that Love=Satan. I said welcome into the club, we are all demons ain satans army in America. I said No we are not! He pushed the egirl aside and said what, you didnt know I was here, HA! This different looking dude who was not japanese threw a bomb blast that would have taken out three blocks but the egirls souls meld in with Yuki and she absorbs the energy like a slurpy drink in her mouth and into her belly. Where she keeps things of interesting nature.

# ACT 2 This Bitch Gets A Lesson in Education

I backhand this bitch back into the stone age. My hand is a backhanded fist and it doesnt even realy strike her and she dissapears making me look like an asshole. She leaves an explosion that takes out 7 city blocks. I am okay, thank you for asking.

One time with the faries, i made angels fly out of their who has. and they were like whoa.

Whatch out there is another meomory sweep coming through. The mind and the technology is already combined. Another mind wipe comes through more often around certain parts. Longer memory people dip out immediately and they never come back.

She strikes again, in another story where she has these three egirls with her, oh wait did I already tell that one, no really theres a ton with some of these egirls she was controlling and they were bad ass. I killed one. She was sweeter than Yuki.

I already killed her. You don't get it. This all happened after the events that you know about. You keep getting it all twisted. No! I am keeping it really reality virtualy focused on reality right now. When I dit max out. I left a bookmark.

I front kicked this cyber bitch and she crumbled like a cake. Then I ate her soul with  an arm twist flick of the wrist to a finger tip and she just blows up in a bloody mist. Like her friends that were in her cult. Like I care.

This other egirl came at me and she fronted for a split second and we actually started kissing because she was beautiful and I worshiped her for a brief moment and burned in love for your soul and but she was evil. so I killed her too. Slurping up a little bit of liquid which keep coming out of this bodies ears and eyes.

I cyber punched this other egirl that came at me with three other egirls. 

...

Florida is infested with hiding. I completely level Lee County with a flick and I backhand another egirl into oblivion. White democrats hiding in closets lying about their sex.

Democrats are childfuckers in the Civil War. Yokai are also the spirits of little girls and little boys that kill evil childfuckers who are all political and all liars about sex.

Democrats created the death cults out of thin air. They just start poping up here and there and people end up dead.
