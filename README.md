# cult-of-akira-yokai
Yokai was sweeter than Akira. When she exploded it killed a lot of souls. A doomsday cult organizes youth and protests the newly formed government when a girl and a boy emerge who can save the world or destroy it.

Akira and Yokai were good little Japanese Nazis. They were loved and they were a part of a sssss ssssnakey super secret organization who was training them to be super NAZI soldiers. Akira killed himself. Yokai was a different story entirely... she still lives!

These Japanese Nazis be lov'in on that White Nazi. These people owned slaves and they owned slaved before the war and they owned slaves after wars secretly in secret organizations that were also death cults.

There was ssss a second explosion. They covered it up and said she died but had no evidence of her body.

The doomsday cults are getting in number again. They are claiming territories in certain places and they are ridiculed in certain other places. The death cults are starting to outnumber the cults of the living again. Live Laugh & Love cults are dying and in search of something to buy, something on a sale. 

They do not worship the bomb yet. Their symbols for death are different. Swastika, Skull and Bones, etc. they were building a army and weapon to use to destroy the world with but they were just children.

Yokai was evil. An evil little girl. She excelled in her studies and was terribly evil. For her, studies were easy to make her slaves do for her. Her mental powers were incredible at a young age. It was like thousands of souls were combining to wield her as a slave of their own. But she was the master. She was an honor student. And she became a therapist using mind control to accomplish a great task that was wiped off the face of the Earth in a single moment.

[Akira is not exactly dead. Tetsuo is not exactly dead. Yokai is not dead at all. Tetsuo went mental and outside of the matrix system when he was in the bar siting on his throne. He allows his body to recompose itself into fleshatombomb. With his body out of the picture and his friends gone, he had to expose of the body somehow, you can re watch this scene and see differences if we change it. ]
